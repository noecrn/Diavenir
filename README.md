> **"Rendre visible l'invisible."** (Make the invisible visible.)  
> A digital solution transforming abstract medical risks into concrete visual motivation.

**Diavenir** is a mobile application prototype designed to bridge the gap between diabetic patients and the long-term management of their pathology. By transforming complex clinical data into intuitive visuals, we aim to trigger the motivation necessary for sustainable lifestyle changes.

## 🧐 The Challenge
Diabetes is a silent major global health issue affecting **1 in 11 adults**. Complications (cardiovascular, renal, optical) often develop over years without specific warning signs. 

Diavenir addresses the psychological barrier of chronic disease: **How can we motivate patients to change their lifestyle today when the consequences of not doing so are invisible and distant?**

## 💡 The Solution
Diavenir makes the abstract concrete by personalizing clinical and biological data to estimate long-term risks.

### The "Silhouette" Concept

* **Dynamic Coloring:** A human silhouette fills with **Green** (healthy) or **Red** (risk) based on clinical parameters.
* **Real-Time Feedback:** As parameters are adjusted (simulating diet or exercise), the silhouette updates instantly to show the impact of lifestyle choices.
* **Organ-Specific View:** Users can visualize specific risks associated with different parts of the body (heart, eyes, kidneys), pinpointing where the "invisible" damage occurs.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
This project was built as an MVP during the **Hacking Health Camp**.

* **Framework:** [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (Cross-platform iOS/Android)
* **Language:** [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
* **Inputs:** Integration of biological and clinical characteristics to estimate risk.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the prototype locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash

    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
3.  **Run the app**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
